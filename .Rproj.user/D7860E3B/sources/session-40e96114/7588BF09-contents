\title{Fuction for filtering gene sets with low expression}
\usage{
filteringPaths(objectMApath, threshold = "sd", n_cores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{objectMApath}{A list of list. Each list contains two elements.
The first element is the Gene Set matrix (gene sets in rows and samples in
columns) and the second element is a vector of zeros and ones that represents
the state of the different samples of the Gene Sets matrix.
0 represents one group (controls) and 1 represents the other group (cases).}

\item{threshold}{A number that indicates the threshold to eliminate a gene
set. For a elimnite a gene set is neccessary that the mean for both groups
are less than the threshold
If  threshold = "sd" the threshold will be the standard deviation of the
gene set. If the standard deviation is greater than 1, the threshold will be
1. The default value is "sd".}

\item{n_cores}{A number that indicates the number of cores to use in the
parallelization. The default value is 1.}
}
\value{
The same objectMApath list but with the gene sets that do not meet
the threshold eliminated.
}
\description{
This function eliminates gene sets with low expression in both groups in
a study
}
\examples{

newObject <- filteringPaths(objectMApth_sim, threshold = "sd")
